                    <p className="font-poppins text-grey mb-7">
                    I am passionate about leveraging my creative and analytical skills 
                    in computer science to develop innovative and user-friendly tech solutions. 
                    Proficient in languages and tools such as JavaScript, Python, React, and Node.js, 
                    I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy tackling new challenges.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My career goal is to secure a role in software development where I can contribute to 
                    impactful projects and continue to grow my technical expertise. I have a robust work ethic 
                    and a strong desire to learn and adapt in dynamic settings.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In addition to my professional interests, I am deeply passionate about fashion, writing and music. 
                    I have self-published a collection of poetry and prose, designed streetwear clothing, and 
                    self-produced an album of lo-fi hip hop beats. While in Japan, I joined the Beatlemania club and 
                    played live shows in Tokyo with a rock band consisting of Japanese students, further fuelling my 
                    love for music and collaboration.
